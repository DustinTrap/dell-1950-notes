CentOS 7 and earlier work fine on this hardware. CentOS 8 drops support for the PERC 5i raid controller and requires loading of the kmods manually.

# Install directions
* Use the rear USB ports, front ports are not bootable. 
* On Windows using rufus, choose the 'iso' format option when creating the USB bootable device.
* If the system will not post, disconnect USB devices and try again.

# Maintenance notes
* I refreshed the thermal paste on both CPUs
* Both RTC clock batteries were replaced on 5/1/2019
